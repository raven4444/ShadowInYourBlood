They have made me watch him for hours through a spying device. Now, according to them, I am ready. Tomorrow I am supposed to give a speech in their favour in Soulforge. After that I will be free.

But I wish it was that easy. Even if they let me go, my conscience won't. They tried to change me, but didn't realize how much I have really changed. Tohid was a great man. Now I understand everything, now I understand what he was fighting for. I feel like he is a big part of me, as though I have a shadow of him in my blood..."
page_1: "Tohid died under torture yesterday, but he didn't give in until the last minute. He died for his ideals, for the freedom of the people. How can I tarnish his image? How can I destroy what he gave his life for?
But what can I do? I am too afraid. I am a petty thief turned intellectual, but I am too weak to do what I believe needs to be done. I have seen what these people are capable of...the physical and mental torture...if I don't co-operate I know what fate awaits me...
But how can I live with myself after this? A great man died for his ideals, and tomorrow I am going to destroy it all. I wish I were dead. I don't deserve to live, for I am scum."
