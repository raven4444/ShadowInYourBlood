The Mechanists came to claim them the exact same day. I understand that they would be very interested in getting their hands on Tohid...but the poor thief? He would not survive the trip to the Meat Mincer. No one does. If there is such a place as hell, I'm sure that is it.

Why would the mechanists want Reza? Must have something to do with his resembelance to Tohid. I'd better mind my own business or I'll end up becoming his cell mate."
