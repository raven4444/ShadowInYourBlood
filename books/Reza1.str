There is this guy in the cell across the hallway who looks so much like me! Maybe I had a twin brother I didn't know of? Too bad they don't let me talk to him.
The captain of the guard told me the Mechanists are coming to take me to a 'special facility'. I don't like the sound of this. Why would they be interested in a lowly thief? Luckily they didn't find my small notebook, I'm gonna leave notes behind just in case someone comes looking for me."
