Still useless for my purpose, my quest for finding a poison that causes pain but not death goes on.
I have also discovered that gouging someone's eye out is not a good torture method, as a blind person is difficult to torture mentally. Neither is cutting out body parts. The excessive bleeding would most likely kill the victim."

And that damned torturer doesn't stop laughing at me! Who does he think he is, with his old and obsolete methods of torture?! He thinks he is so important because the head priest trusts him with the key to his room. If he doesn't stop making fun of me I swear he would become the first victim of this new poison that I have just invented."
