This week it is his turn to carry the armory key, but today for the third time in two days he forgot the combination for the armory safe where we keep the riot gear. The captain got so pissed off he wrote the combination in big letters on the noticeboard next to the window in the cafeteria. We all laughed our guts out. 
Poor Benny hasn't been seen since then...I wonder where he is hiding. He is probably in some hole drinking himself blind. I just hope we won't need to get inside the armory tonight."

page_1: "Talking about the cafeteria, I feel like having a coffee right now! I wonder why the captain locks it everyday at 5pm and takes the key home with him along with the key to his room. He is probably afraid we might skip our duties and spend the night in there.

Both the captain and his deputy are so paranoid, locking their offices and taking the keys with them every night."
